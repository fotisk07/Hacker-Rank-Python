## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
The Code is written in Python 3.6.5 . If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. 

To install pip run in the command Line
```
python -m ensurepip -- default-pip
``` 
to upgrade it 
```
python -m pip install -- upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```
to upgrade Python
```
pip install python -- upgrade
```
### Structure
Each project is inside a folder indicating its dificilty and the subdomain it belongs. For example the py-hello-world-English program is an easy programming assignement ( folder -- easy ) and it is an introductory one ( folder -- Introduction ) . Each programming assignemnt is also accompanied by a pdf file,bearing the same name, provided by Hacker Rank which explains the assignement.
